# Candlelight

Candlelight is a lightweight yet powerful web application designed to let users create, share, and play their favorite tabletop games online. With a focus on User Experience (UX), Candlelight simplifies the process of joining, hosting, and creating games, making it accessible to everyone, from casual players to hardcore tabletop enthusiasts.

## Features

- **Easy Game Hosting and Joining:** Host and play common tabletop games online by simply visiting the website and entering a code—no user account required.
- **Custom Game Creation:** Utilize Candlelight’s rules engine interface to create new games with custom rules, pieces, and materials.
- **Seamless User Experience:** Designed for ease of use with a clean interface that caters to all users, from ages 9 to 99.
- **Web-Based Access:** No need to download or install applications. Play directly in your web browser, both on desktop and mobile devices.
- **User-Generated Content:** Support for creating and playing user-generated games, enhancing the variety of available content.

## Why Candlelight?

Candlelight aims to address the shortcomings of existing platforms:

- **Compared to TableTop Simulator:** Unlike TableTop Simulator, which is a paid program requiring every player to have their own copy, Candlelight is a free web-based application with an intuitive user interface. It avoids the complexities and costs associated with other platforms.
- **Compared to Jackbox:** While Jackbox offers a fun experience, it lacks support for user-generated content. Candlelight provides not only pre-made games but also full creative freedom for users to design their own games.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Angular/TypeScript
- **Backend:** GoLang
- **Caching:** Redis (with plans to use Redis as a cache layer before MongoDB)
- **Database:** MongoDB (planned)
- **Hosting Service:** AWS Hosting planned for deployment stage
