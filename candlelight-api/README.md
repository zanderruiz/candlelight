# Candlelight-Api

API Server for the Candlelight project. All API endpoints should be located within this module, but heavier lifting should probably be done in a different module (i.e. in candlelight-ruleengine for anything RuleEngine related)

To use this, clone it into a sibling directory to the other Go modules. If you have questions, ask Ryan
