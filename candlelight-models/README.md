# Candlelight-Models

Defines the Model system that the backend of this project will be using. Because this is the expected system, note that any changes here may break things when interfacing with [the frontend](https://capstone-cs.eng.utah.edu/candlelight/Candlelight-Frontend).

## Use this Module
Clone the module into a sibling folder to the rest of the backend repositories. When you're done, you should have a folder containing
the folders `candlelight-models` `candlelight-api` and `candlelight-ruleengine`
